# DINNER CONNECT BACKEND

## Overview

This project is a Node.js application designed with modern development practices, featuring a clean architecture and an efficient stack for building robust web applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: v20.9.0
- **Command Line Tools**: Nodemon
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ORM**: Prisma

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure for scalability and maintainability:

```
src/
├── prisma.schema.js  # Database models and schema
├── router/           # Routes Handlers
├── controllers/      # Request handlers and route logic
├── services/         # Business logic and reusable functions
├── libs/             # Utility libraries and helper functions
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js v20.9.0
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses **Nodemon** to monitor changes and automatically restart the server during development.

## Database Configuration

This project uses **MongoDB** as the database with **Prisma** ORM for schema management and querying. Make sure your MongoDB server is running, and update the connection string in the Prisma configuration file.
